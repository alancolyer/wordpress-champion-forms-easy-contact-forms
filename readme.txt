= 1. Visitor friendly contact forms. =

No one likes filling out forms. This is an axiom. A good contact form is a contact form, which is comfortable for site visitors. Period.
A contact form, designed in a visitor friendly way, is never an accident. There are too many things to consider: form responsiveness, label placement, form design or suggestions you add.
The world admires people who has brilliant intuition, but, for the rest of us, there is only one working formula: MEASURE and CHANGE, and then MEASURE and CHANGE again.
Anyone can select the measurement tool they want to use: which one they like better, Google analytics or the amount of cash he has in his pocket.
Easy Contact Forms is a tool helping to  change a site's front door (Aka a contact form). A minute will be enough to change the contact form layout. A few minutes will be enough to add several fields.
Testing the results of the improvements on every 100 or so of visitors, you will eventually make your contact form friendly and comfortable for your site visitors. Easy Contact Forms will help you.

= 2. Easy to use contact form builder. =

No one likes bothering with complex, pointless tasks that have no purpose now or in the future.
If you were to ask us the best way to learn the best way to create a contact form, we would answer, "Why are you learning how to create contact forms at all? Don't you have more important things to do for your business?"
The intuitive drag and drop interface does not assume that you have knowledge of programming or web design.

= 3. Various contact form field types and field customization. =

Please see the Easy Contact Forms FAQ Section.

= 4. Reasonable anti-spam protection and several validation layers. =

When we say reasonable, we're assuming that you know how to increase the contact form anti-spam protection when it is necessary.
Hidden fields, along with several built-in anti-spam filters, will do the job transparently for site visitors.
Easy Contact Forms supports both server and client side contact form submission data validation. Client side contact form validation guarantees that a site visitor gets instant feedback, allowing making quick corrections.
Server side validation guarantees that a contact form will work in browsers, when JavaScript is disabled.
Server side validation plays a crucial role of contact form's second line of defense.

Several fields allow you to connect a contact form with the contact database.

= 6. Where can I find information about other Easy Contact Form objects? =

1. The Entries tab of the contact form object contains a list of form entry list. The Process entry data button adds a new contact.
2. The Users object is intended to store information coming from contact forms.
3. If a contact form is configured to store data in the database, the plugin will try to find a user, having an entered email address and will create a new contact if the contact is not found.
4. The Application settings Send from field is an email address, used to send notification messages.
5. The Admin part of intensively uses jQuery, but the front end part contact forms do not use jQuery. 
6. Plugin successfully works in browsers even when JavaScript is disabled.

= 7. I have installed Easy Contact Forms, but I do not receive contact form submission notifications. What did I do wrong? =

First, check if outgoing messages are sent if all the email address fields on the contact form Notifications and Confirmations pages are blank. In this case your default wp admin address will be used. (The only place where you should fill the address is your contact form primary recipient email). If you do not see any messages from your contact form, check your Wordpress email settings and make sure that your Wordpress installation sends email messages at all. After you begin receiving messages step by step add more addresses and names on the contact form Confirmation and Notification pages not forgetting to test each step.

= 8. Which phone formats are supported by your contact form? =

Phone format regular expression is found on the Easy Contact Forms (Web) -> Settings page.

= 9. I click on the links to add the fields to the contact form notification email template, but nothing happens. =

This issue occurs occasionally with Internet Explorer 9. Please try using Firefox or Chrome to edit your contact form settings.

= 10. I tried putting a reCaptcha field on my contact form, but it never showed up (not in the preview and not in the saved form on the web page.) =

Open the Set reCatpcha options panel. You will find a link where you can get reCaptcha private and public keys for your site. It will take up to a minute. Insert the public and private keys into the corresponding contact form setting fields. Please make sure that you do not insert a public key into the private key field and vice-versa. Avoid inserting extra symbols and spaces

= 11. When I press the submit button the contact form returns 'Error. Status=0' error. =

You will most likely see this error message because the site domain names in WP Settings Word Press Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) fields are different. Several browsers take this a security issue and do not allow normal contact form data sending. The best way to fix this issue is to set equal domain names in both fields. Another way is to try to set the Fix Status = 0 checkbox on the ECF Settings page. In this case the contact form submission function in the contact form preview window may stop working correctly.

= 12. I deleted the placeholder users and now it just says 'Please Log in' and I can no longer making any changes to my contact form =

You will see this message because you have deleted the user with admin credentials. The simplest way is just to reinstall the plugin. WARNING: this will delete your contact form settings. If you already have important information entered, please contact our support team. After reactivating the plugin please add a new user, enter your contact data and assign the Super Admin role to that user.

= 13. I have created a contact form, but no what I do, the submit button will not display =

Most probably your theme does not support loading wp_enqueue_script function when it loads shortcode content. The simplest way to check is to open the page html source and to try to find a file 'easy-contact-forms-forms.(version).js'. If you do not find the file, try to go to the Settings Page and select the Fix JS loading check-box. That may fix this issue. If, after that, it is still not fixed, that means that there are other compatibility issues. We wish you every success in trying other contact form plugins. One more common reason of this error is third-party JavaScript errors produced by the pages which contains the contact form.

= 14. Where can I find a detailed description of the contact form builder fields? =

= 15. How do I make my contact form W3C (XHTML and HTML5) compliant? =

Please take into consideration that a contact form may behave in this mode slightly different and after you made this change you should revisit each contact form you have on your site.  
1.	Open the Easy Contact Forms Settings panel and check the Run in w3c compliant mode checkbox.
2.	Open each contact form and make a slight change to it. For example check (or uncheck) the Redirect checkbox font on the contact form General Settings page, click Apply, then change it back and click Apply again. 
3.	Open each Text Area field you have on a contact form and do the same. I.e.  Set (or unset) the Show label checkbox, click Apply, change the value back and click Apply again. 
4.	Do the same with each Submit button found on your contact form. 
5.	Open the contact form on the front end and check if it looks good and test it. 
6. Open the contact form on the front end and check if it looks good and test it. 
The function allowing to see a contact form in the preview window is currently (v.1.4.5) not compatible with the w3c compliant mode. 
In order to change everything back, please uncheck the the Run in w3c compliant mode checkbox. Click Apply and repeat steps 3-6
